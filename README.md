When open the file using VS Code
Set Open Folder to open the folder containing dataset.

So your current directory will be the FNCE-449-term-data-main that contain folder dataset (the child FNCE-449...)

Before running the file, go to terminal and run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

The original file is the jupyter notebook file including raw data and some other information that is deemed not significant for the model
The finalized model is the .py file with instruction on whichcode did what commented above the codes
requirements.txt is the installing requirement needed to run the project
the dataset file contains all of the original raw data used by the model
.DS_Store is created after downloading and unzip so I don't think it is included
regression_input is created whenever the code runs
